# Contributing to Waives

:green_heart: *Thank you for taking the time to contribute!* :green_heart: We know that contributing
to an open-source project is time-consuming and sometimes can be stressful too. This guide is here to
help you with your contributions.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Waives Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to abide by and to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behaviour
to [community@waives.io](mailto:community@waives.io).

## TL;DR

Please:

1. **Be friendly and respectful to all with whom you interact here.** Remember text is a lossy communication format
and what you write _will_ be interpreted differently from how it was meant.
2. **Use the bug and pull request templates provided.** These are here to make everyone's lives easier, contributors
and maintainers.
3. **Keep your commits and pull requests small.** A small commit is easier to understand, to cherry-pick, revert, and
undo. Pull requests are easier to review, and so will be merged more quickly, if you keep them small. 
4. **Follow the coding guidelines.** We have tried to make these easy-to-follow and not too demanding; hopefully it
will be clear from the code files themselves, but there are also written guides for reference. 
5. **Include clear and thoughtfully-worded tests.** Tests should only test one thing, and they should clearly describe
the behaviour they're trying to test. Take your time over test names. 

:pray: Thank you for your time and contributions! :pray:

### But I just have a question to ask!

We'd love to answer your questions! We'll be happy to answer your questions via email at support@waives.io, and we
expect to implement lower-friction communication methods such as chat and message boards in time as the project and
community grows. Please do _not_ file issues to ask questions; these are for work items (e.g. bugs, features) only.
