## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Waives Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to abide by and to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behaviour
to [community@waives.io](mailto:community@waives.io).

## TL;DR

1. **Be friendly and respectful to all with whom you interact here.** Remember text is a lossy communication format
and what you write _will_ be interpreted differently from how it was meant.
2. **Use the bug and pull request templates provided.** These are intended to make everyone's lives easier.
3. **Keep your commits and pull requests small.**
4. **Follow the coding style guidelines.**
5. **Include clear and thoughtfully-worded tests.**

### I just have a question to ask!

Please do not file issues to ask questions; we'll be happy to answer your questions via email at support@waives.io.
We expect to implement lower-friction communication methods such as chat and message boards in time as the project
and community grows.
